## Understanding the Business Persona
After launching 5G in May 2022, the company saw a drop in active users and slower revenue growth. Management wants to compare key metrics from before and after the 5G launch to understand what went wrong. They aim to find insights and improve their internet plans to bring back users and boost growth.


## Project Goals

- Identify reasons behind the drop in active users and revenue growth.
- Uncover trends and patterns in user behavior post-5G launch.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of current internet plans.
- Suggest data-driven strategies to recover user engagement and improve revenue.
